A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.  Lesson 6 – Active Buzzer

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast again, with the next Lesson number 6 “Active Buzzer”.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the tutorial closely, without overburdening the viewer with every detail, but I will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit.  I’m pronouncing it El-E-Goo, I hope that’s right (I sometimes slip and say El-a-Goo).  No, Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

For this video, we’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to learn what an active buzzer is and how to use them in our projects.  I step through the Elegoo provided code to explain how it makes this happen.  The pulsating tone makes a great pet scaring circuit.  And as I was just about to finish the video, I got this idea on making a Morse Code Translator circuit.  The Morse Code Translator circuit used the active buzzer, LED, couple of resistors and a few jumpers to the Arduino.  The code is a little more advanced, so I’ve included some additional links below that covers some of the topics.  Now, I have to admit that I use my phone to record all the live video shots, and I have to sync them up in my editor.  Which is Movie Maker for Windows (cue the sad trombone).  It was a challenge to mesh the screen capture and live capture together. But I assure you that the code works.  I like to thank learnelectronics and Nick B for inspiring me to create the Morse Code Sketch.  And the Programming Electronics Academy has a great video “An easy way to make noise with Arduino using tone()”,  which may apply more towards the next lesson but he has a fantastic piezo buzzer explanation.  

Of course, I’ve added Serial.begin, Serial.print, and Serial.read statements to view and diagnose the code in the Serial Monitor.  I hope you like the Lesson, it was a lot of fun to make.

Parts you’ll need:
Arduino UNO R3 board
Active Buzzer (that the one with a white sticker on it)
Two female-to-male wire jumpers

The next lesson will be Lesson 7 – Passive Buzzer
