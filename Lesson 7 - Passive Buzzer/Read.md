A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.  Lesson 7 ñ Passive Buzzer

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast here with the next Lesson number 7 ìPassive Buzzerî.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the tutorial closely, without overburdening the viewer with every detail, but I will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit.  Iím pronouncing it El-E-Goo, I hope thatís right (I sometimes slip and say El-a-Goo).  No, Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

For this video, weíll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino kit.  Iíll list the items below.  In this lesson weíre going to learn what a passive buzzer is and how to use them in our projects.  I step through the Elegoo provided code to explain how it makes this happen.  I also ran into some problems with what was recommended from piezo manufacturers, and other web sites, with whatís provided in the tutorial.  So I explain my findings, and restart the tutorial.  I even revise the provided sketch to include a scale that plays up and down.  For bonus material, I created a music player inspired by the Happy Birthday Melody for the Nano with 3-way Polyphony by Liss.   I use the prototype board and mini breadboard thatís included in the kit.  I did have to purchase additional passive buzzers to make this work (links below).  I quickly take you through the changes in the code and play the Happy Birthday melody in 3-Way Polyphony.  I repeated this for the Star Wars Imperial March (not Polyphony), and Super Mario theme melodies.  Sorry, I did ramble a few times.  But overall, I had a blast and maybe Iíll revisit the project in the future. 

I hope you like the Lesson, it was a lot of fun to make.

Parts youíll need for the basic tutorial:
Arduino UNO R3 board
Passive Buzzer (that the one without a white sticker on it ñ youíll need two more if you want to do the bonus sketch)
One diode (5 are provided in the kit)
One 100-ohm resistor
Several jumpers
Breadboard

The Bonus Music Player parts are:
Arduino UNO R3 board
Three passive buzzers (links are provided below)
Three 100-ohm resistors
Three 1N4007 diode 
5mm Red LED
5mm Yellow LED
5mm Green LED
Three 220-ohm resistors
Various jumper wires
Mini breadboard
Elegoo prototype board
The next lesson will be Lesson 8 ñ Tilt Ball Switch and the Magic 8-Ball
