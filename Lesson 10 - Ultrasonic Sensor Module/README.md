A beginner's guide to the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.  Lesson 10 – Ultrasonic Sensor Module 

Hello everyone, I'm Rick the Tech Enthusiast here with the next Lesson number 10 “Ultrasonic Sensor Module”.  This is the next lesson on my Arduino UNO Series covering the Most Complete Starter Kit by Elegoo.   I try to follow the tutorial closely, without overburdening the viewer with every detail, but I will point out any changes or corrections as I find them.

As mentioned before, I purchased this Elegoo starter kit.  I’m pronouncing it El-E-Goo, I hope that’s right (I sometimes slip and say El-a-Goo).  No, Elegoo isn't sponsoring me.  I just thought it would be fun to do a video of each Lesson as I was learning the Arduino environment. 

For this video, we’ll need a few things from your Elegoo Arduino kit.  I’ll list the items below.  In this lesson we’re going to learn about the Ultrasonic Sensor Module provided in the kit and how to use it in our projects.  I step through the Elegoo provided code, which uses a Library, and explain how it makes this happen.  Then I develop a sketch, without the need of a Library, to fully demonstrate how the sensor module works.  I discuss a little about the speed of sound, and finally I create a circuit that includes a display and an interrupt driven button to switch modes.  I run across a few issues and the solutions to fix them.   Fun project, I hope you enjoy it. 

### Parts you’ll need for the basic tutorial

* Elegoo Arduino UNO R3 board
* Ultrasonic Sensor Module HC-SR04
* Four male-to-male jumpers
* Breadboard
* Miscellaneous breadboard jumpers
* Temperature gauge
* And a ruler

### Additional items needed

* LCD 1602 16x2 screen module
* 10K potentiometer
* Tactile push button switch
* And a few more male-to-male jumpers and breadboard jumpers 

The next lesson will be Lesson 11 – Membrane Switch Module
